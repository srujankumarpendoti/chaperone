Description

This React application simulates a fully functional e-commerce website for Chaperone, showcasing products with a focus on user experience, responsive design, and clear navigation.

Features

Search Functionality: Users can search for products using a search bar.
Product Listing with Carousel: Products are displayed in a visually appealing carousel. This carousel offers a smooth and responsive user experience on various screen sizes.

"View Product" Button: Redirects the user to a dedicated Thank You page showcasing the product details.
"Add to Cart" Button: Triggers a modal displaying the product information for confirmation before adding it to the cart.

Responsive Design: The website is built using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, ensuring optimal layout and styling across different devices (desktops, tablets, mobiles).

Navigation:
Users can navigate easily between the product listing page and the Thank You page using React Router, a powerful routing library for React applications.

Technologies Used:

React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
